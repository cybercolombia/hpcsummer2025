    "### C++17: Parallel STL Algorithms\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the major milestones in C++17 was the extension of the Standard Library’s algorithms to support parallel execution. Many algorithms (e.g., **std::for_each**, **std::transform**, **std::reduce**, and others) gained overloads that accept an *execution policy* parameter from the `<execution>` header. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```cpp\n",
    "#include <algorithm>\n",
    "#include <execution>\n",
    "#include <vector>\n",
    "\n",
    "std::vector<double> inVec = /* ... */;\n",
    "std::vector<double> outVec(inVec.size());\n",
    "\n",
    "// Multiply each element by 2 in parallel:\n",
    "std::transform(std::execution::par, inVec.begin(), inVec.end(), outVec.begin(),\n",
    "               [](double v) { return v * 2.0; });\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, the policy `std::execution::par` tells the implementation that the algorithm may execute in parallel. Another policy, `std::execution::par_unseq`, additionally allows vectorization. This high-level approach enables an almost “drop-in” change to existing STL algorithms, improving readability and portability.\n"

    "- **Executors & Future Enhancements:** Although not fully standardized at the time of C++20’s finalization, proposals and early implementations (in libraries like HPX) offer standardized executors. These executors abstract the notion of “where” and “how” tasks execute, thereby providing a unified interface to schedule work in parallel.\n",

In contexts like matrix multiplication, modern C++ parallel algorithms can deliver substantial performance improvements in a much cleaner way, while OpenMP might be preferred in performance-critical or highly tuned HPC applications.\n",
